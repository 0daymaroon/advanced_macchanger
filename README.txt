H3ll0 fri3nd, advmacchanger.py is an advanced linux mac changer script coded by me in python3 using subprocess and time module. This script allows you to change your mac address as many times as you want, automatically without any later interaction.You first need to enter the interface of whose mac you want to change and the no. of times you want it to change. Then you'll be asked for the mac addresses and time limits(in seconds)you want them to stay for, after all the time limits are over, the script will restore back your original MAC automatically and that's when it ends. After starting, let the script run in the background. To run, just open terminal in the folder you saved the file and type "python3 ./advmacchanger.py"
Remember to give permission to execute the script and Make sure you have installed python3 and termcolor module in your linux system.Try opening with sudo if it doesn't works.


Thanks!
